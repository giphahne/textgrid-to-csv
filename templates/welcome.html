		This app is almost ready to go! Just two more steps.
		Go to the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/info/{{ app_key }}">App Console</a>
		and make these changes:
	  </p>

	  <ol>
		<li>Add the following as an OAuth 2 redirect URI: <code>{{ redirect_url }}</code></li>
		<li>Add the following as a webhook URI: <code>{{ webhook_url }}</code></li>
	  </ol>

	  <p>
		(You might also want to click the
		"enable additional users" button if you haven't
		already. Otherwise no one else will be able to log in to your app.)
	  </p>

	  <p>
		Once your done with all that,
		<a href="{{ home_url }}">try the app out yourself</a>.
